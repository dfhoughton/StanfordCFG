This is a project to wed the [Stanford NLP Group's][stanford] sentencing, lemmatization, and POS tagging tools with my Grammar project to facilitate constructing rule-based grammars for natural languages. The idea is that you can write a grammar like so

    NP := <D>? <Nb> | <NP> <PP>
    Nb := <AP>* <N>
    AP := 'very'? <A>
    PP := <P> <NP>

and get this grammar to pull noun phrases matching this grammar out of text tokenized and POS tagged by the CoreNLP tagger.

Dependencies
------------

This code depends on the Stanford [CoreNLP][] libraries and models.

It also depends on my [Grammar][] project:

To run the tests in the `test/` directory, you will need [JUnit 4][junit].
